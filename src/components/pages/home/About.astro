    <p>
      Hey! I'm Josh. I've always been a dreamer with a hunger to create things. I spent the earlier
      part of my life focusing on music - playing guitar, recording records, and performing with my
      friends. These formative years exploring my musical and artistic voice inexplicably led me to
      the vast, terrifying beauty that is the modern web, and learning to build things with code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wave Land Web came about after a couple of big life changes for myself and my wife. In late
      December 2020, we moved from our home in Philadelphia, PA to Madison, WI and I took a
      sabbatical from my music career to scratch the itch I had for web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few years of working with some amazing clients and building tons of personal projects,
      I began to notice that many people struggle with decision fatigue when they have website
      needs, and finding the right resources to build their own websites can be overwhelming. I
      created Wave Land Web to simplify this process and to empower creatives and small businesses
      with the resources and knowledge necessary to thrive online and create websites that bring
      their brand and personality to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wave Land Web allows me to support the communities I love with the tools and education they
      need to succeed. On the web, it's possible to make almost anything, so the challenge is
      building unique, thoughtfully branded websites that feel intuitive and accessible to a diverse
      audience. My goal is to help musicians, artists, and small business owners achieve their
      professional dreams by building custom web experiences that support their vision and inspire
      creativity, all while prioritizing user experience.
