    <summary>What kind of websites do you build?</summary>
    <p>
      I generally build brochure, blog, and e-commerce websites. A brochure website is like an
      online business card, showcasing your work. A blog is perfect for sharing your thoughts and
      engaging with your audience. An e-commerce site allows you to sell products or services
      directly from your website.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How long will it take to build my website?</summary>
    <p>
      The time to build a website varies based on its complexity. A simple brochure website can be
      completed in a few weeks, while a more intricate e-commerce site might take a couple of
      months. Rest assured, I'll work closely with you to set realistic timelines.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can you help me choose a domain name for my website?</summary>
    <p>
      Yep! Domain names are a whole thing and are especially important when it comes to search
      engine optimization (SEO). I can assist you in finding the perfect domain name that aligns
      with your brand and captures your unique identity. Informed by your preferences, I'll help you
      secure a memorable web address.

  <details>
    <summary
      >Do I need any pre-existing technical knowledge to maintain and update my website?</summary
    >
    <p>
      Nope! I believe in empowering my clients with the knowledge necessary to be successful website
      owners. All updates are handled for you at an affordable hourly rate, or I can set up your own
      intuitive content management system (CMS) that allows you to update your website easily, even
      if you have limited technical experience. Unlimited customer support is provided at no extra
      cost.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can you help with content creation?</summary>
    <p>
      Knowing what content to include on a website can be overwhelming. In addition to building and
      hosting your website, I am here to help with content planning, SEO and marketing goals, and
      all other project management-related steps.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary
      >What happens if I want to add new features or pages to my website in the future?</summary
    >
    <p>
      Websites are alive and ever-evolving and I am here to support you even after initial website
      development. Reach out anytime to discuss your needs and I will provide you with a tailored
      solution to accommodate any updates or additions.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can you optimize my website for search engines (SEO)?</summary>
    <p>
      For sure! By default, every website is built while paying close attention to things like
      search engine optimization (SEO), accessibility (A11y), and performance. I'll optimize your
      site's structure, meta tags, and content to improve its visibility in search engine results
      and help you attract more organic traffic.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes! Mobile accessibility has never been more important. All of the websites I create are
      fully responsive, meaning they will look and function great on all devices, from smartphones
      to tablets and desktops.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can you provide hosting and maintenance for my website?</summary>
    <p>
      Absolutely! I offer a hosting package at an affordable monthly cost that ensures your website
      remains secure, loads quickly, and is regularly backed up. I also provide ongoing maintenance
      to keep your website up to date. However, some folks like to handle these things on their own,
      and that is totally fine! In these cases, I can help you get set up with recommended hosting
      and remain available for updates at my normal hourly rate.

    <summary
      >Why work with a professional developer when I can use low-code website builders like Wix,
      Webflow, or Squarespace?</summary
    >
    <p>
      I love low-code tools, and sometimes use them myself! While builders like Wix, Webflow, or
      Squarespace are user-friendly and provide many benefits, a professional developer offers
      unique insight to help create custom functionalities and ensure optimal performance and
      scalability. With a professional developer, you gain personal support, technical expertise,
      and a carefully tailored website that reflects your brand and stands out from the crowd.
      Overall, I prefer to build custom-coded websites but am happy to set you up with a low-code
      option of your choice.

    <summary>How much will my website cost?</summary>
    <p>
      The cost of a website depends on various factors, such as its complexity, features, and the
      amount of customization required. Click <a href="/service-offerings-and-rates.pdf" download
